•	Sprint number : Sprint two
•	Name of the .cs file being reviewed : FireMario.cs
•	Author of the .cs file being reviewed : Sam
•	Number of minutes taken to complete the review : 10 minutes 
•	Specific comments on what is readable and what is not : 
     The code is very readable. The variable names all correspond to the related usage. There could be simplification of  variable instalization. I.e. private readonly TextureRegion standingLeftSprite, standingRightSprite, jumpingLeftSprite, jumpingRightSprite, crouchLeftSprite,CrouchRightSprite; The comments are nice to fully understand what is going on within the code. The method names are very clear to what the functionality is. 

In the plaintext file for a code quality review, include the following information:

•	Name of the .cs file being reviewed : OneUp.cs
•	Author of the .cs file being reviewed : Sam 
•	Specific comments on code quality : The code is very clean, and everything makes sense. The methods are very short and readable. 
•	A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change 
     One hypothetical change that could be made could be the location of the item due to the block location it is hidden in. This implementation would support this change. This would just be changing the location value. For example, location = new Vector2(500,500), the 500’s would change depending on block.
